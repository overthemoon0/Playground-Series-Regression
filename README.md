The final place of this notebook is 84 out of 765.

This notebook was generated within 2 hours based on another my notebook (https://www.kaggle.com/code/nikoolaylovyagin/playground-series). The generated pipeline seems to be an appropriate baseline for at least these two datasets and might be considered applicable starting framework for other Regression tasks.
